# FAQ's answered

## What third-party sites does MetaCPAN use?

* [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) is where all the Perl modules live.
MetaCPAN 'just' indexes those files.
* [Perlybook](http://perlybook.org/) provides the MOBI and EPUB download capabilities.
MetaCPAN provides direct links to download the POD in the respective formats.
* [CPAN Testers](http://www.cpantesters.org/) collect test reports of the CPAN modules.
MetaCPAN show the number of test reports and links to the tests.
* [CPANTS](http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) provide Kwalitee metrics for CPAN modules.
MetaCPAN links to the respective pages on the CPANTS site.
* [CPAN Ratings](http://cpanratings.perl.org/) allows users to give stars and review CPAN distributions.
MetaCPAN show the average rating using stars and links to the reviews.
* [search.cpan.org](http://search.cpan.org/) is another search engine for the same data.
It is older, but the source code has not been published.
MetaCPAN links to the respective page of each module/distribution.
* [RT](https://rt.cpan.org/) is an installation of [Request Tracker](https://www.bestpractical.com/rt/)
that provides a default bug~ and issue-tracking system for every CPAN distribution.
Unless the author of the module configured it otherwise MetaCPAN will link the respective RT Queue
of every distribution.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular public version control system among Perl module developers.
Many distributions indicate it as their public VCS. Some of them even mark GitHub as their preferred
issue tracking system. MetaCPAN links to the GitHub repository and bug tracking system of each distributions
if the author has included the information in the META files.

## How to list all the Plack Middleware?

Search for <a href="/search?q=module:Plack::Middleware">module:Plack::Middleware</a>

## In general, how to list all the modules in a name-space?

Type in <em>module:</em> and the namespace such as <a href="/search?q=module:Catalyst::Plugin">Catalyst::Plugin</a>,
<a href="/search?q=module:Dancer::Plugin">Dancer::Plugin</a>,
<a href="/search?q=module:Mojolicious::Plugin">Mojolicious::Plugin</a>,
or <a href="/search?q=module:Perl::Critic::Policy">Perl::Critic::Policy</a>.

## A non-comprehensive list of special search expressions:

These search-terms can be combined with each other and regular search term.

* <em>module:</em>  filter by part of a  module name ( e.g. [module:Plugin](/search?q=module:Plugin) )
* <em>distribution:</em> search in the files of the specific distribution ( e.g. [distribution:Dancer auth](/search?q=distribution%3ADancer+auth) )
* <em>author:</em> search in the modules releases by the given author ( e.g. [author:SONGMU Redis](/search?q=author%3ASONGMU+Redis) )
* <em>version:</em> limit the search to modules with the given version number ( e.g. [version:1.00](/search?q=version%3A1.00) )

Wildcards: ? matches a single character, * matches any number of characters
( e.g. [version:1.*](/search?q=version%3A1.*) and [version:1.?](/search?q=version%3A1.?) )

## Why can't I find a specific module?

See our [missing module](/about/missing_modules) page.

## How can I get involved / who is involved?

* [Contact us](/about/contact)
* [Development information](/about/development)
* [Who else has contributed?](/about/contributors)

## Where can I find the API docs?

The API docs can be found by visiting [fastapi.metacpan.org](https://fastapi.metacpan.org).
API requests need to be sent to fastapi.metacpan.org.

## How can I try the API?

[https://explorer.metacpan.org/](https://explorer.metacpan.org/) is an easy way
to try sending queries to the back-end.

## Why can't I link my PAUSE account?

### Is your PAUSE email set up?

If you are a module author you can link your [PAUSE](http://pause.perl.org/)
account to your MetaCPAN account. But you must configure the email address
forwarding in your PAUSE account for this to work.

### Connecting one identity disconnects another?

If you can only connect your account to GitHub _or_ PAUSE
(e.g. connecting to one disconnects the other), it is usually because
you have (probably accidentally) created two accounts.

To fix this:

1. Log in with one of them
2. Go to identities and disconnect that account
3. Log in with the other and connect to the first

### Trying to connect PAUSE just gives you JSON and doesn't work?

It is possible to get your account into an inconsistent state where it won't
connect to PAUSE - particularly if you've connected via multiple identities,
and/or using multiple browsers.

To fix this:

1. Disconnect all identities
2. Remove all cookies from `metacpan.org` and `fastapi.metacpan.org`
3. Reconnect via one identity
4. Connect to PAUSE

Make sure that you use the same browser for all of the steps - including
opening the link in the email from MetaCPAN.

### Favorites not displaying on author page?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/852).

## Oops! I made a mistake.  Can you delete my module?

Requests to have modules removed from the CPAN should be directed at the PAUSE
admins.  Keep in mind that, if a module contains sensitive information, just
deleting it from your CPAN directory is not enough, as it will still reside in
the BackPAN.

If the PAUSE admins approve your request, have them CC noc@metacpan.org so that
we can push the right buttons to have your work removed from MetaCPAN as well.

## Can I _automatically_ redirect links pointing at search.cpan.org to metacpan.org?

For Chrome users, the [MetaCPAN
redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metacpan-redirect/ojemidgoiffinacbckopjjndlobmgpmk)
extension will automatically rewrite search.cpan.org links to MetaCPAN.

You can accomplish the same thing by modifying your <code>hosts</code> file
(*Note*: these IP addresses may have to change over time, as we move servers,
so come back here to check, if things stop working).
Add the following lines and all links to search.cpan.org (and links to source
code) will be redirected to MetaCPAN:

    5.153.225.19 search.cpan.org
    5.153.225.19 cpansearch.perl.org

If you do this, be sure to point cpanm to another mirror, as it defaults to
search.cpan.org. Here's how:

    export PERL_CPANM_OPT="--mirror http://www.cpan.no/" # Insert your closest mirror here.

## Can I _manually_ redirect links pointing at search.cpan.org to metacpan.org?

If you find yourself to be on search.cpan.org and you want to get redirected to
corresponding metacpan page, just change the domain name with
search.**m**cpan.org. For example:

    http://search.cpan.org/~xsawyerx/MetaCPAN-API-0.43/lib/MetaCPAN/API.pm

has to be changed to:

    http://search.mcpan.org/~xsawyerx/MetaCPAN-API-0.43/lib/MetaCPAN/API.pm
                  ^

## What is the relation of MetaCPAN to author-*.json and the data in a PAUSE account?

Every CPAN module author has an account on [PAUSE](http://pause.perl.org/pause/query).
That account has some profile data in it (full name, ascii name, e-mail, and homepage).
Authors can edit those at [Edit Account Info](https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred).
This information is collected and distributed by PAUSE via the
[00whois.xml](http://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.xml) file.

In addition PAUSE users can upload a file called author.json or author-1.0.json to the root
of their PAUSE account with other information.

When someone asks MetaCPAN for information about an author (a PAUSE account),
MetaCPAN will provide the data from the MetaCPAN account that was associated
with the given PAUSE account. If no such association exists then MetaCPAN
will default to the data found in the PAUSE account of the user
(via the 00whois.xml file), and to the content
of the latest author-*.json file found in the PAUSE account of that user.
(If there is such a file.)

Once a PAUSE account is connected to a MetaCPAN account, the information
in the MetaCPAN account is initialized from those sources
(00whois.xml and author-*.json) and from that point MetaCPAN disregards
any changes made to those files.

As of October 2014 [search.cpan.org](http://search.cpan.org/) uses only the data in the
PAUSE account (via the 00whois.xml). It does not use the data from the author.json
files and from MetaCPAN.
Thus it might show a different e-mail address or homepage of a user then what MetaCPAN does.

If you, as a PAUSE author would like to keep them in sync, you can always export your MetaCPAN
account information in json format by accessing http://fastapi.metacpan.org/author/PAUSEID
(replacing the word PAUSEID by your own PAUSEID). Then you can upload the result as author-*.json
with a higher version number than the last one you uploaded.
The PAUSE account information need to be updated manually via
[Edit Account Info](https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred).
